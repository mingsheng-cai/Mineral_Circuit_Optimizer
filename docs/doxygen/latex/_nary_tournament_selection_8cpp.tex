\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the \doxylink{class_nary_tournament_selection}{Nary\+Tournament\+Selection} class for performing n-\/ary tournament selection in a genetic algorithm. 

The \doxylink{class_nary_tournament_selection}{Nary\+Tournament\+Selection} class provides methods to perform n-\/ary tournament selection on a population of individuals to select individuals for the next generation. This class is designed to be used in genetic algorithms to select the fittest individuals based on tournament competition among a subset of the population.
