\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the \doxylink{class_guided_mutation}{Guided\+Mutation} class for performing guided mutation operations in a genetic algorithm. 

The \doxylink{class_guided_mutation}{Guided\+Mutation} class provides methods to perform guided mutation operations on individuals in a genetic algorithm. This class is designed to introduce targeted variations into the population by modifying individuals\textquotesingle{} genetic material based on specific rules or heuristics, which can then be used in subsequent generations of the algorithm.
